# Ride Price Estimation System

## Project Overview
This project uses Machine Learning (Linear & Logistic Regression) to predict ride-hailing prices based on distance, surge multipliers, and vehicle type.

## Key Features
* **Price Prediction:** Estimates the exact fare ($) with 95% accuracy.
* **Cost Classification:** Flags rides as "High Cost" or "Low Cost" for budget-conscious users.

## Structure
* `data/`: Contains the synthetic ride dataset.
* `notebook/`: Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis and model training.

## Results
* **Linear Regression R²:** 0.95
* **Logistic Regression Accuracy:** 97%
